# Slide

A highly customizable sliding tile game!

## What is slide?

Slide is a combination puzzle that challenges players to slide pieces along fixed horizontal and vertical routes to re-establish a complete image from a shuffled image.  
Try to complete in the lowest amount of time to get ranked!

## How to play

Click on a tile to try to move it.  
If there is an empty tile next to it, the clicked tile will move into the empty space.  
If the empty tile is on the same row/column as the clicked tile, the entire row/column, until the empty space, shifts to fill the empty space.
